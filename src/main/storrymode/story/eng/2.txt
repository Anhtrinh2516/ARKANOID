	A crow cawed before taking flight, a lump of human flesh in its beak. Kaito’s vision darkened, and he could hear the roar of countless voices. A mass of people, clad in black and shaking their fists, shouted as high as their voices would allow. “Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!”

	All their loathing and overwhelming bloodlust were concentrated on one dark-haired girl.

	She was hovering in front of them, dressed in a straitjacket. Hundreds of chains hung from the gallows, binding her hands and feet while keeping her suspended in midair. She resembled a butterfly caught in a spiderweb. She looked up from her fluttering black locks.

	Her face was terrifying in its beauty, and her striking crimson eyes turned to Kaito. He gasped.

	It was clear from her expression that she was no victim.

	She was looking past Kaito at the raging, bloodthirsty crowd. Her pointed gaze was devoid of fear.

	Upon her immaculate face was a smile rife with cruelty and wickedness.

	“Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!” The mob continued their chant, and she laughed as she bathed in their murderous rage. She laughed at it all in a manner both beautiful and sinister.

	—Until the day of your death, try to do some good at least.

	And then, with a firm crack, Kaito Sena’s neck was snapped.

	Kaito Sena, the boy who should be dead, opened his eyes once more. The light of a bonfire filled his gaze. He appeared to be in a dimly lit stone room. Although he was sure that he’d been killed, this didn’t quite strike him as the land of the dead. Standing in front of the confused Kaito was the black-haired girl from before.

	She was no longer being restrained, although in a sense, she still appeared bound.

	Covering her slender body was a black bondage dress, and the part over her chest was composed almost entirely of leather belts. Her well-formed breasts, bound beneath the interlacing belts, were over half-visible. Her waist was concealed by black cloth, and past her short skirt extended a pair of gorgeous legs wrapped in what looked like stockings. The inside of her dress was dyed scarlet, and the length of the back flowed like a cape. It was quite the erotic outfit, yet somehow it did not give off a flirty impression.

	The way she wore the indecent bondage-style dress was akin to a queen in her finest regalia.

	Her elegant, flowing black hair suited her face, which was more refined than any Kaito had seen before. Yet, a demonic cruelty flickered in her ruby eyes.

	At once, the peerless beauty parted her thin lips. Her gaze locked on to Kaito, and she spoke at last.

	“O Sinless Soul, stricken down in a manner most foul. From this day forth, you shall be my loyal servant.”

	Although it made little sense to demand the servitude of a dead man, her tone left no room for refusal. Belatedly, Kaito realized that he was breathing, and as he let slip a small chuckle of confusion, the girl before him made a dignified proclamation.

	“I am the Torture Princess, Elisabeth Le Fanu. I am the proud wolf and the lowly sow.”
